\section*{\textbf{1.\hspace{1cm}\textcolor{red}{\underline{\huge{INTRODUCTION}}}}}
\hspace{1cm}\large{\emph{Advancements in Healthcare have always catalyzed  patient services by enabling individualized and accessible care. The types of innovations that have enabled a very optimistic primary healthcare experience by creating new market via unique set of algorithms and values and thereby replacing most of the existent technologies and facilities can be termed as “disruptive innovations". Disruptive innovations in healthcare can create a new system providing a continuum of care by emphasizing on each individual patient's needs, rather than just focusing on complex disorders and urgent health crises. Because of great Advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, NPs and physician assistants can competently diagnose and treat disorders that would have previously required the support of a physician.\vspace{1cm}\newline}} 
\hspace{1cm}\large{\emph{Even today Healthcare is ineffective and complex to deal with for the clinicians despite so many improvements. It's high time that some sophisticated and palpable technology comes in that can allow a smooth and reliable functioning of healthcare and ease up the work of Healthcare professionals by solving the conventional Healthcare issues. Let's get introduced to some of the highly emerging and market disrupting innovations that are finding ways through healthcare:}}

\subsection*{\textbf{\hspace{1cm}1.1.\hspace{1cm}\textcolor{red}{\underline{\huge{BLOCKCHAIN}}}}}
\hspace{1cm}\large{\emph{Blockchain can be used to secure any patient data, enabling easy transfer while at the same time keeping it secure by only allowing those with consent to access it.}}\vspace{1cm}\newline
\hspace{1cm}\large{\emph{Using blockchain, smart contracts can be created on a private ledger. Only a patient or healthcare professional qualified to see such data can cryptographically sign to access the data they need. Blockchain and smart contracts can be a critical step in securing this data, being easily accessible only when verified by the qualified people who need to access it. This would replace the existing patient Hospital Database Management records and system which is highly vulnerable and insecure. Already during the Covid pandemic, EHRs and blockchain have found ways in Healthcare for quick and secure data transfers. Hence, in the coming years we can expect a potential growth in this aspect of Healthcare technology.}}

\subsection*{\textbf{\hspace{1cm}1.2\hspace{1cm}\textcolor{red}{\underline{\huge{PRECISION MEDICINE}}}}}
\hspace{1cm}\large{\emph{Precision medicine offers selective patient-specific treatment and preventive actions according to the genetic makeup, overall lifestyle and environmental susceptibility and interactions of the patient. Since every patient has a different medical requirement in cognizance to the genetic nature, precision medicines can prove to be really helpful by catering to this ardent need. Many environmental and genetic factors are involved in bringing on particular conditions; precision medicine can be suggested based on diagnostic and molecular genetic testing. This testing can help doctors treat and even prevent the onset of some severe medical conditions. Genome sequencing can illuminate DNA mutations that an individual is susceptible to. From there, a physician can come up with a pinpointed treatment plan and medicine to prevent or minimize the damage done by the disease. Precision medicine will facilitate the preventative health necessary to reduce the time and money spent on treatment and the overall amount of patients who require healthcare in the future.}}

\subsection*{\textbf{\hspace{1cm}1.3\hspace{1cm}\textcolor{red}{\underline{\huge {INTERNET OF THINGS-IOT}}}}}
\hspace{1cm}\large{\emph{The IoT is significantly changing how easily healthcare professionals can communicate and exchange data with colleagues and patients. Big Data and AI Automation has significantly improved the overall functioning of Hospitals and enabled quick communications and services.}}\vspace{1cm}\newline
\hspace{1cm}\large{\emph{The IoT is changing everything from patient records and monitoring to inventory control to preventative care. Communication and collaboration between healthcare professionals can now happen in real-time — an extremely beneficial aspect of the healthcare industry. The IoT may be the most prominent technology-making wave in healthcare. Many of the technologies disrupting the sector are only made possible through the interconnectivity of devices, applications, the internet, and the cloud.}}

\section*{\textbf{2.\hspace{1cm}\textcolor{red}{\underline{\huge{CONCLUSION}}}}}
\hspace{1cm}\large{\emph{The current healthcare is very difficult to be managed by clinicians because of end no. of inefficacies and instabilities in technologies. The future of Healthcare has many disruptive innovations in its womb because of endless loopholes. The above listed innovations are only some them which will grow Iike anything in the future and create entry-barriers for all other conventional methods of Healthcare services and management. Let's hope for some of the best and lucrative innovations uprooting in the coming decades and solving the existing healthcare problems.}}
